For the Healthy Urban Living Lab at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, I designed and built a website together with a fellow student for their Bajeskwartier project. We chose SvelteKit with a CMS and made sure the site was easy to find through strong SEO and GEO optimisation. After the soft launch, other developers will take over the project.
