        I'm 19, living in Volendam and studying Frontend Design & Development. 
        I like experimenting with different tools and frameworks, from Astro and 
        SvelteKit to Ai tools and e-commerce platforms. The goal is simple: 
        make projects not just prettier, but smarter and better.
      </p>
      <p class="m-0 text-muted">
        Performance, SEO and accessibility matter to me. A good website is more 
        than just looking nice. It needs to be fast, discoverable, and usable 
        for everyone. I also enjoy taking ideas and turning them into something 
        functional.
